# Saagia

Saagia is a Qt Creator based qml/C++ application for visualizing weather and electricity data from Fingrid and Finnish Meterological Institute. The app gathers information from the sites and combines them in various ways into visualized form and presents it to the user. 
## About

The app is made in groups of four, as a part of Software Design course in Tampere University in spring 2021. The project follows guidelines given on the course.

## Requirements

This application is made with Qt Creator version 5.12. Older versions might have issues running the code. The app requires extra module QtCharts in order to work properly.

## Versions
21.2: First prototype of the app, made to present basic layout of the UI as well as some basic functionality the end product will have. This version also includes a chart made from data fetched from Fingrid.
21.3: Mid-term submission of the app. Some of the functions implemented and working properly, rest of the application planned.
